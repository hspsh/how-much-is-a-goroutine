An Experiment
=============

This is an experiment and a bit of research: I want to compare reliability, performance and memory consumption of:

1. Program that spawns separate goroutine to do calculations; and
2. Program that spawns limited number of goroutines and uses channel to pass work.

Results will be added here at some point in future :)
